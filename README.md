# Intel® RealSense™ SDK for Linux ROS Samples

## Build Status
ROS Kinetic: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IntelRealSense/realsense_samples_ros.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IntelRealSense/realsense_samples_ros)

## Features
These samples illustrate how to develop OSRF&reg; ROS* applications using the Intel® RealSense™ [ZR300](http://click.intel.com/intelr-realsensetm-development-kit-featuring-the-zr300.html) camera for Object Library (OR), Person Library (PT), and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).

## Installation Instructions

The Intel RealSense SDK for Linux is used as the base for these ROS node.  Full installation information for the SDK is available at https://software.intel.com/sites/products/realsense/intro. Here is the quick setup guide:

```bash
# Install ROS Kinetic full desktop environment
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install Intel RealSense SDK for Linux
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key D6FB2970 
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://realsense-alm-public.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-repo xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/realsense-latest.list'
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install -y librealsense-object-recognition-dev librealsense-persontracking-dev librealsense-slam-dev libopencv-dev

#install compile depends
sudo apt-get install libomp-dev

#clang compile will failed ,so please manual switch to gcc if compile failed and remove directory "catkin_ws/src/build" (if already exists)
#sudo update-alternatives --config c++

# Download and compile ROS wrappers for Intel RealSense SDK for Linux
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src/
catkin_init_workspace 
git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense_samples_ros
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Usage Instructions
- [Camera](realsense_ros_camera/README.md): This ROS node implements use of ZR300 camera as a standard ROS camera node.
- [Object Recognition, Localization, and Tracking](realsense_ros_object/README.md): This ROS node demonstrates use of ZR300 camera above to implement Object Recognition, Localization, and Tracking functionality.
- [Person Tracking and Analysis](realsense_ros_person/README.md): This ROS node demonstrates use of the ZR300 camera above to implement Person Detection, Tracking, and Gesture analysis.
- [SLAM](realsense_ros_slam/README.md): This ROS node demonstrates use of ZR300 camera above for simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM), relocalization, and occupancy map generation.
